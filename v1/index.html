        <h2>Steps for Creating a Landing Page</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Define Your Goal:</strong> Clearly define the purpose of your landing page. Are you looking to generate leads, sell a product, or promote a service? Your goal will guide the design and content.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Your Audience:</strong> Know who your target audience is. Understanding their needs, pain points, and behavior will help in crafting a message that resonates with them.</li>
            <li><strong>Craft a Compelling Headline:</strong> Your headline is the first thing visitors will see. Make sure it’s compelling and directly communicates the value of what you’re offering.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Engaging Content:</strong> Use concise and persuasive language. Highlight the benefits of your offer rather than just the features. Include social proof, testimonials, or case studies to build trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Design for Usability:</strong> Keep the design simple and focused. Ensure the navigation is intuitive and that the page is mobile-friendly. Use contrasting colors for important elements like call-to-action (CTA) buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize Your Call-To-Action:</strong> Your CTA should be prominent and clear. It should tell users exactly what you want them to do. Use action-oriented text like "Get Started," "Join Free for a Month," or "Download Now."</li>
            <li><strong>Include a Form:</strong> Keep forms short and straightforward. Only ask for essential information. Place the form prominently on the page to increase conversion.</li>
